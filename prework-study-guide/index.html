          <li>This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element in the HTML's head.</li>
          <li>Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *.</li>
          <li>The period preceding designates as a class selector.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
